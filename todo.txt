to add:

-fox circle:
	-currently doing math to check if rabbit enters. Could switch this to collision.

-bush that the rabbit can move into to enter hidden state
	-collision: when the rabbit enters the burrow, set its State to 'hidden'

-the hole. anyone who moves into the hole can no longer move.
	-if the fox moves into the hole then play a party sound

-navmesh for pathfinding
	-this will change some things. Namely, where we just use vector.moveTowards() we will switch this out
	I hope the change is that simple.

-multiple rabbits and switching between them with key presses 1/2/3
