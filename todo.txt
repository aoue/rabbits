to add:

-the hole. anyone who moves into the hole can no longer move.
	-if the fox moves into the hole then play a party sound, you won.

-navmesh for pathfinding
	-this will change some things. Namely, where we just use vector.moveTowards() we will switch this out
	I hope the change is that simple.

-create an actual level with something interesting going on
	-needs the navmesh, needs some sort of challenge for the player
	-add multiple rabbits and foxes at the same time?

-(MAYBE) cannot control rabbits directly: (for more playfulness?)
	-can place carrots on map, and rabbits go to carrots
	-rabbits have a hungry stat, and won't move for a certain time after they eat carrots

-mini presentation and demo for class
	Notes to hit:
	-game premise
	-AI as _, explain each of these.
